those gains linked to monthly revisions for October\nsupplies, while cargo prices also jumped.\nWhile German domestic prices were assessed €10/t\nfirmer after some price erosion caused by plentiful supply\nand high stocks being sold off during September, other key\nnorthwest European markets like Benelux, UK and France\nregistered €20/t, £20/t and €20-25/t gains respectively.\nBut not all monthly deals between sellers and buyers had\nbeen agreed and confirmed by 1 October, with more details\nexpected from 4 October.\nCzech domestic and export prices also strengthened\non tight refinery supply, although there was still plentiful\navailability overall in most central and southeast European\nmarkets.\nSharp gains in fob Rotterdam high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO)\nprices in the last week of September drove up outright\nbitumen values, but such gains coupled with early signs of\nwinter and demand slowdown in parts of the Nordic/Scandi-\nnavia region encouraged a modest $2-3/t slippage in Rot-\nterdam and Baltic cargo export premiums to HSFO that were\nassessed at $25-30/t and around $20/t fob respectively.\nCross regional freight rates for standard 5,000t cargoes\nwere yet to be pushed down significantly, but slim assessed\ndeclines took Thames-bound rates to $22-24/t from Rotter-\ndam, $29-31/t from Hamburg, $47-49/t from Klaipeda and\n$39-43/t from La Coruna.\nuk\nDomestic truck prices in the UK were assessed £20/t firmer\nat £380-390/t ex-works and £395-405/t delivered after Octo-\nber monthly price hikes that followed hefty crude and fuel\noil gains during September,
