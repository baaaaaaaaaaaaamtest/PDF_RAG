But a key refiner is expected to open a sell tender for\nits November loading cargoes in the coming weeks. Demand\nfrom China remains weak and is anticipated to remain a\nbearish factor for the Korean sellers.\nMeanwhile, some key refineries are continuing to produce\nless bitumen on the back of strong HSFO economics. The\nreduced physical volumes of bitumen has helped to balance\nthe overall supply availability for October.\nDomestic prices in South Korea were raised by $51/t for\nOctober, as recent firmness in crude values lent to higher\ndomestic selling prices. Demand outlook for October remains\nslightly mixed, with local players wary of the recent spike\nin Covid-19 cases following the Thanksgiving festival holiday\nrecently.\nIn Japan, domestic prices were raised by ¥1,000/t to\n¥63,513-71,619/t ex-tank. Demand in September has been\nmostly stable against the previous month. More roadworks\nare expected to commence in October, though some proj-\nects might slow down with the upcoming general elections\nin November. Some sellers were anticipating slightly tighter\nsupply in October, with one refiner’s terminal in Yokohama\nundergoing maintenance.

The upward revi-\nsions were seen as mostly in line with the firmness in global\ncrude prices, with domestic demand expected to improve\npost-Golden Week. Another smaller state-owned refiner\nalso raised listed prices by 230 yuan/t at its terminal in the\nsouthwest.\nOngoing power shortages in parts of China had limited\nimpact on production. Some refineries in areas affected by\npower shortages may have slowed the rate of production,\nbut supply levels were mostly unaffected.\nA state-owned refinery in Shandong also resumed opera-\ntions on 25 September after a planned turnaround. Two\nrefineries in the east and in the south are due to undergo a\nmonth-long maintenance from October. Overall supply levels\nare expected to remain ample with the refiner planning to\nraise overall bitumen production by about 50,000-100,000t\nin October.

In east China, an offer for an October-loading South\nKorean cargo was at 3,250 yuan/t. About 7,000t of October-\nloading cargo from South Korea were also concluded at\n3,300-3,350 yuan/t to east China. This could not be con-\nfirmed. Another importer concluded a very prompt 5,000\nSouth Korean cargo which loaded this week at $424/t cfr\neast China.\nIn south China, no firm discussions for imports were\nseen amid scant buying interest. An offer for November and\nDecember-loading cargoes from a Singapore-based refiner\nwas made at $460/t cfr south China.\nHigher freight rates were quoted for cargoes from South\nKorea to east China, with ship owners having to contend\nwith higher demurrage fees due to ongoing port congestion,\nparticularly along the Yangtze River. Freight rates were at\n$38-45/t for 5,000t cargoes, though few to no buyers were\nwilling to take the higher offers.\nAustralia & New Zealand\nIn the state of Victoria, the ongoing construction sector\nshutdown in Melbourne and other areas will be lifted from 5\nOctober, with stringent Covid-19 measures in place. One sell-\ner estimated a reduction of around 50pc of sales this week\ndue to the shutdown, with some slowdown also attributed\nto the wet weather. Overall demand is expected to pick up\ngradually in October and firm further in November.\nDiscussions were ongoing for November-loading cargoes,\nwith indicative offers at higher than current fob Singapore\nlevels. One importer also concluded a 7,000t cargo from\nsoutheast Asia for loading mid-November on a formula basis.\nIn New Zealand, demand from Auckland is expected to\nreach similar levels to the rest of the country gradually, with\nroadworks picking up despite the city remaining under the\nstricter “level 3” Covid-19 measures.

As a result,\nbitumen production also fell by at least about 22pc during\nthe same period.\nMeanwhile, bitumen sellers have seen weak demand in\ndomestic as well as regional markets. Producers have also\nseen an increasing squeeze on margins on the rising cost of\nVB feed prices. This, coupled with stronger high-sulphur fuel\noil (HSFO) economics, has resulted in higher production of\nfuel oil and has reduced export volumes.\n“We reduced trading activities for bitumen as there is\nno profit margin, and have switched to other products,” said\nseveral local traders.\n“As a producer, we have faced losses over the past\nmonths and were forced to sell our cargoes only to pay our\ndebts from purchasing VB feed that was bought earlier,” said\nseveral producers.\nAs a result, the number of companies trading or selling\nbitumen within Iran has fallen over the past few months.\nA gap was seen in buy-sell expectations as higher offers\nbased on higher costs of production were rejected by buy-\ners from key markets. This was further underpinned by the\nimpact of Covid-19, which resulted in issues with government\nfunds and slowed paving activities in recent months.\n“We purchased VB feed at 70,274 rials/kg [$285/t] and\nproduced bitumen at $315/t fob, including storage and VAT\ncosts, but we have sold without any profit,” said industry\nparticipants.

This was sup-\nported by a possible move by Iranian refineries to increase\nfuel oil production because of higher demand, in contrast to\nweak demand from bitumen producers.\nOn the other hand, Iran's bitumen exports in August slid\nby 32pc compared with a month earlier and was 48pc lower\nyear-on-year amid low demand from Asian markets. Exports\nfell to about 221,730t in August, down from 326,000t sold\nin July. Meanwhile Iran’s export sales stood at 431,000t in\nAugust 2020, according to data from the Iran Mercantile\nExchange.\nVietnam’s bitumen demand to rise\nBitumen demand from Vietnam looks set to increase in the\nnext few years, supported by an ambitious road develop-\nment plan that seeks to construct over 5,000km of express-\nways between 2021-2030.\nThe Road Network Development Plan which was unveiled\nthis month seeks to develop over 5,000km of expressways in\nthe country by 2030, up from 3,841km in 2021.\nKey areas for expressway development include exten-\nsions to the ongoing North-South Expressway project, as well\nas the 14 expressways in the north, which alone would total\nabout 2,305km.

The country imported close to 890,000t\nof bitumen in 2020, the highest in the last five years. New\nroad construction projects are expected to continue as the\ngovernment pushes for infrastructure development in tan-\ndem with economic goals, and has positioned Vietnam as an\nattractive business hub.\nThe road development plan is also aligned with Vietnam’s\n11th Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP), which covers\nthe period of 2021-2025 and includes the goal of achieving\nan average Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 6.5-7pc in the\nnext five years.\nGhana's new bitumen terminal delayed\nGhanaian state-owned oil and gas marketing firm Goil has\npushed back the completion date for a new $35mn bitumen\nterminal and conversion project at the port of Tema to the\nend of this year.\nThe 6,000t terminal — which will supply imported AC-10\nand AC-20 bitumen performance grades to newly built poly-\nmer-modified bitumen (PMB) and bitumen emulsions plants\n— had been slated for completion by the end of this month.\nCovid-related issues are understood to be partly responsible\nfor the delay.\nGoil's joint venture partner in the project is Ivory Coast\nbitumen producer and exporter SMB, which has 300,000 t/yr\nof bitumen production capacity at its Abidjan refinery. The\nproject was announced in 2017 and construction work began\ntwo years later. It is now 94pc complete.\nOnce operations start, bitumen imports into Tema will be\nfed to the terminal by a 3km pipeline, which will be electri-\ncally heated to keep the road paving product liquid before it\nis discharged into Goil's newly built storage tanks.\nThe imported bitumen will then feed into the styrene-\nbutadiene-styrene PMB plant, which will have the capacity\nto produce 30 t/hour. Some local market participants expect\nincreased use of PMB in major road and highway projects in\nGhana over the coming years.\nOne domestic construction sector player said its use had\nyet to be pursued aggressively by the country's highways au-\nthorities. The bitumen emulsions plant will have a capacity\nof 60 t/hr. Bitumen emulsions are already in much wider use\nin Ghana than PMB.\nCopyright © 2021 Argus Media group\nLicensed to: Shi Jia Lim, Argus Media Limited (London)\nPage 20 of 22"}
